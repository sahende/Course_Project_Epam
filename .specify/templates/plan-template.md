# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [TDD-first — list concrete test frameworks and plan for unit, integration, contract and (if applicable) E2E tests].

**Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)**: The plan MUST include a TDD-first testing section that explicitly lists:
- The failing tests to author first (unit -> integration -> contract -> E2E), with file paths.
- How tests map to acceptance criteria in the spec.
- CI expectations (typecheck, lint, unit + integration tests, contract tests, secret-scan) and thresholds (coverage/mutation) where applicable.
- A short schedule for when mutation testing will run (e.g., nightly on `main`) and which branch gates require mutation thresholds.
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

## Secrets & Rotation (required when auth/credentials are changed)

- ACTION REQUIRED: If the feature touches authentication, tokens, or secrets, the plan MUST include a `Secrets & Rotation` subsection containing:
  - Where secrets will be stored (env vars, secrets manager) and access controls.
  - Key rotation procedure (key IDs, grace window, migration steps) and a rollback plan.
  - DB migration steps for credential/token changes and data-migration safety notes.
  - CI checks and runtime checks to ensure secrets are not leaked in responses or logs.

Rationale: Changes affecting secrets or tokens are high-risk and require explicit, auditable plans.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

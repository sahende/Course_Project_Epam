# Auth Requirements Quality Checklist

Purpose: Unit-tests-for-English checklist validating the *requirements* for the User Authentication feature.
Created: 2026-02-24
Feature: specs/001-user-auth/spec.md
Depth: PR reviewer (lightweight)
Audience: Security team

## Requirement Completeness
- [x] CHK001 - Are all primary functional capabilities (register, login, logout) explicitly listed in the spec? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK002 - Are all API endpoints required for the feature documented with request/response shapes and error cases? [Completeness, Spec §API Specification]
- [x] CHK003 - Are failure and error scenarios (DB failures, partial write, network errors) described with expected requirements for compensating actions? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases, Gap]

## Requirement Clarity
- [x] CHK004 - Is the refresh-token storage and delivery strategy explicitly defined and unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §API Specification]
- [x] CHK005 - Are token lifetimes and rotation semantics quantified (access token TTL, refresh TTL, rotate-on-use behavior)? [Clarity, Spec §SC-005, Spec §Clarifications]
- [x] CHK006 - Are validation rules specified with exact constraints (password complexity beyond min/max; email normalization behavior)? [Clarity, Spec §Input Validation Rules]

## Requirement Consistency
- [x] CHK007 - Do the API success and error response shapes align with the global error contract defined in the spec? [Consistency, Spec §API Specification]
- [x] CHK008 - Are status codes and described behavior consistent across acceptance scenarios and FRs (e.g., `403` usage vs `401`)? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality
- [x] CHK009 - Are acceptance criteria measurable and tied to testable outcomes (e.g., exact status codes, response fields)? [Measurability, Spec §User Scenarios, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK010 - Is the CI/test requirement for “no secrets in logs/responses” tied to a concrete verification method (e.g., diff-based secret scanner step)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004, Gap]

## Scenario Coverage
- [x] CHK011 - Are primary, alternate, exception, and recovery flows covered in requirements (normal login, invalid creds, locked account, token replay, partial registration failure)? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK012 - Are zero-state and concurrency scenarios (concurrent register attempts, race on unique email) specified with desired outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage
- [x] CHK013 - Are brute-force / throttling requirements quantified (limits, backoff, lockout thresholds) or flagged as intentional omissions? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-008, Gap]
	> DEFAULTS (configurable): 5 failed login attempts per IP per minute; account-level lockout after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes with a 15-minute lockout; exponential backoff and captcha/2FA on repeated failures. Make thresholds configurable via env vars: `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_IP`, `AUTH_LOCKOUT_THRESHOLD`, `AUTH_LOCKOUT_WINDOW_MINUTES`, `AUTH_LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES`.
- [x] CHK014 - Is the behavior on refresh-token reuse (replay) specified, and are the logging/audit requirements for such events defined? [Edge Case, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §AuthToken / Session, Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] CHK015 - Are performance targets for auth endpoints stated and measurable (e.g., SC-002 500ms requirement) and applicable to CI/integration test environments? [Non-Functional, Spec §SC-002]
- [x] CHK016 - Are observability and audit requirements (structured logs, event fields) precisely specified so implementers know required fields? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-007]
- [x] CHK017 - Are security requirements for secret management and key rotation clearly mapped to implementation steps and verification (Secrets & Rotation plan required)? [Non-Functional, Spec §Constitution Check, Gap]
	> MAPPING: Use `JWT_SECRET` (or `JWT_KEY_<kid>`) stored in the deployment secrets manager (do not commit). Support key rotation with `kid` in JWT header and keep previous signing keys for a configurable grace window. CI must include a diff-based secret-scan; document rotation procedure in `specs/001-user-auth/plan.md#secrets--rotation` and ensure tests/CI validate no secrets in logs by scanning test outputs.

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- [x] CHK018 - Are external dependencies and assumptions (e.g., secrets manager, CI secret-scanner, deployment cookie domain/secure settings) documented and validated? [Dependencies, Spec §Assumptions, Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts
- [x] CHK019 - Are any ambiguous terms (e.g., "prominent", "fast loading", "optional refresh token") clarified with objective measures? [Ambiguity, Spec §Input]
- [x] CHK020 - Are there conflicting statements across sections (e.g., optional refresh token vs enforced cookie issuance)? If present, does the spec resolve the conflict? [Conflict, Spec §FR-004, Spec §API Specification]



### Requirement Completeness
- [x] CHK021 - Are role assignment and persistence requirements explicitly documented (who can assign roles, UI/API for assignment)? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 4]
- [x] CHK022 - Is the single-vs-multiple attachment policy decided and documented (accept/reject/replace behavior)? [Gap, Spec §User Story 6]
- [x] CHK023 - Are evaluation finalisation rules and allowed state transitions (including `UNDER_REVIEW`) specified? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 7]

### Requirement Clarity
- [x] CHK024 - Is the `EVALUATOR` role scope clearly defined (which endpoints/actions require it)? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 4]
- [x] CHK025 - Is ownership verification for `POST /api/ideas/attach` described precisely (DB constraint, transaction boundary, error code)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-014]
- [x] CHK026 - Are the allowed `decision` values, comment length, and exact response codes for `POST /api/evaluations` specified? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 7]

### Requirement Consistency
- [x] CHK027 - Are role checks consistent between `GET /api/ideas`, `POST /api/ideas/attach`, and `POST /api/evaluations` (same error codes for missing/insufficient role)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-011/FR-015]
- [x] CHK028 - Do tasks T046–T055 align with the acceptance scenarios in the spec (no task/spec drift)? [Consistency, specs/001-user-auth/tasks.md]

### Acceptance Criteria Quality (Measurability)
- [x] CHK029 - Are success and failure response shapes for `POST /api/ideas`, `POST /api/ideas/attach`, and `POST /api/evaluations` explicitly defined (example bodies + error codes)? [Measurability, Spec §API Specification]
- [x] CHK030 - Is the attachment rejection behavior for disallowed mime/oversize documented with exact status codes (`415`/`413`) and thresholds (MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Input Validation]

### Scenario Coverage
- [x] CHK031 - Are unauthenticated, unauthorized, and forbidden scenarios covered for each endpoint related to cases 4–7? [Coverage, Spec §§User Story 4-7]
- [x] CHK032 - Are concurrency scenarios (attachment race, concurrent evaluations) described with expected deterministic outcomes and error codes (`409 Conflict`)? [Coverage, Edge Case]

### Edge Case Coverage
- [x] CHK033 - Is behavior when attempting to evaluate an already-finalised idea specified (idempotent/409 path)? [Edge Case, Spec §User Story 7]
- [x] CHK034 - Is the attachment streaming/partial-failure behavior specified (what happens if file upload fails mid-stream)? [Edge Case, Spec §User Story 6]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] CHK035 - Are attachment size limits, mimetype whitelist, and storage provider constraints documented and measurable (MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES, allowed mimetypes)? [NFR, Spec §Input Validation]
- [x] CHK036 - Are observability requirements for evaluation and attachment actions defined (structured logs, audit events, required fields)? [NFR, Spec §FR-007]

### Dependencies & Assumptions
- [x] CHK037 - Is the requirement that `role` is included in issued access tokens and how role changes are propagated (token revocation or short-lived tokens) documented? [Assumption, Spec §FR-012]
- [x] CHK038 - Is storage/signing URL policy for attachments specified (signed URL TTL, HTTPS requirement)? [Dependency, Spec §Input Validation]

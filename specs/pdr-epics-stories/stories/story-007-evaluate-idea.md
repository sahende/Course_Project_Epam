## 3. User Story
As a reviewer I want to submit an evaluation so that ideas can be scored and ranked for consideration.

---

## 4. Description / Details
- Implement `POST /api/ideas/:id/evaluations` that records score and optional comment; update aggregated metrics.
- Decide duplicate evaluation policy (update existing vs reject) and document it.

## Main Flow
1. Reviewer opens an idea and fills evaluation score and optional comment on the client.
2. Client sends `POST /api/ideas/:id/evaluations` with the evaluation payload.
3. Server verifies reviewer permissions, stores the evaluation, and updates aggregated metrics.
4. Server returns 201 Created and the updated aggregation values.

## 5. Priority
Medium

## 6. Story Points / Estimate
3 points

## 7. Assumptions
- Reviewer role and permissions exist.

## 8. Dependencies
- Auth role checks and aggregation background jobs or DB triggers.

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-007-001: Submit evaluation
**Scenario:** Reviewer submits evaluation
```gherkin
Given a reviewer and valid evaluation payload
When POST /api/ideas/:id/evaluations is called
Then server returns 201 and evaluation is stored
And idea aggregated score is updated
```

### AC-007-002: Duplicate handling
**Scenario:** Duplicate evaluation attempt
```gherkin
Given a reviewer that already evaluated the idea
When the reviewer posts another evaluation
Then server follows the chosen duplicate policy (update or reject)
```

---

## 10. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for aggregation and duplicate handling.

---

## 11. Definition of Done
- ACs met and tests added.

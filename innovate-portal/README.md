# InnovatEPAM Portal (Phase 1)

This repo will host the InnovatEPAM Portal MVP.

Structure:
- `src/` - application source (auth, ideas, evaluation)
- `specs/` - SpecKit stories and ADRs
- `docs/` - documentation and PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- `tests/` - automated tests

We will use SpecKit for spec-driven development. Next I will ask a few clarifying questions to shape the specs and tech choices before implementing features.
